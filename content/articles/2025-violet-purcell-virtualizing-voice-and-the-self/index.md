Since the inception of electronic music, there seems to be a part of it that is inextricably linked to gender identity and expression. Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, we’ve seen many genderqueer pioneering electronic music artists, from Wendy Carlos in the 1970s to SOPHIE in the 2010s. This has been quite extensively touched upon in existing literature, however there exists one relatively recent niche of electronic music that presents a unique avenue of queer expression: music made with voice synthesis technology, often colloquially called Vocaloid music. In the past couple of years, an artist has risen to prominence in the English-speaking portion of this musical niche: Jamie Paige. The music of Jamie Paige offers a unique perspective on transgender identity and expression through electronic music, and how it interacts with the voices of transgender individuals.

## Vocaloid Music

In some capacity, voice synthesis technology has existed for over 80 years at this point. Unsurprisingly, the first developments in the area were courtesy of Bell Labs, the laboratory behind much of our modern telecommunications network. At the 1939 New York World’s fair, Bell Labs unveiled the Voder: a massive golden face that could be manipulated by an operator to create a modicum of speech. Another key moment in the evolution of speech synthesis was Texas Instruments’ Speak & Spell, introduced in 1978. At this point, digital speech synthesis existed, but was of mediocre quality and was prohibitively expensive. The Speak & Spell proved that it was viable for speech synthesis to be put into a broadly available commercial product, albeit in an extremely limited form and still with questionable intelligibility. The term “Vocaloid” can be used to refer to multiple different things. VOCALOID is a program developed by Yamaha, and is the technology used to create Vocaloid music. For disambiguation, the software will be referred to as VOCALOID, while the culture/genre will be referred to as Vocaloid. VOCALOID began development in the year 2000, born as a dissertation project at Pompeu Fabra University in Spain. The project had significant backing from Yamaha, who would go on to use the technology for the commercial VOCALOID software. However, VOCALOID would not see much success until Crypton Future Media released the MEIKO voicebank. While Yamaha was responsible for the development of the VOCALOID software, voicebanks were created by other companies, the most notable being Crypton Future Media. In 2007, VOCALOID2 was released alongside Crypton Future Media’s new voicebank: Hatsune Miku.

With Hatsune Miku, Crypton Future Media created not only just an instrument, but a character. Attaching an image of a cute girl to a product or concept was not new in Japanese culture, but rather just an example of moe anthropomorphism. Patrick W. Galbraith of Senshu university writes that moe is “an affective response to fictional characters”. In practice, this typically means that a character designed to induce moe has large eyes, a thin figure, and straddles the line between being “cute” and “attractive.” By attaching a character that is just concrete enough to work off of, but leaves room for interpretation, Hatsune Miku captured the attention of artists involved in Japanese doujin culture. A doujin is a group of people who create works, often works that are derivative in nature or created as a hobby. Songs using Miku would begin appearing in large quantities on the video sharing website Nico Nico Douga. Many of these songs would eventually make it from Nico Nico Douga over to YouTube, either reposted by the original artist or a third party. From there, Vocaloid music would start growing in the English-speaking parts of the internet.

## The Transgender Voice

In our society, we tend to tie certain vocal characteristics to certain genders. Thus, it is natural that when a transgender person seeks to alter their gender presentation, they would want to alter their voice. One of the most essential elements of voice that is tied to gender is pitch. Voices that are pitched lower tend to get classified as more traditionally masculine, while voices pitched higher tend to get classified as traditionally feminine. In the case of people who want to lower the pitch of their voice (typically transmasculine people), this is pretty simple, as masculinizing Hormone Replacement Therapy can naturally lower the pitch of the voice. However, for transfeminine people, it is a struggle. With our current medical knowledge, the lowering of the voice that occurs during testosterone-driven puberty cannot be reversed. Many transfeminine people train themselves to speak in the higher range of their voices, and to alter their speech cadence to sound more feminine, however in many cases the voice can still remain a sore spot. This compounds when the singing voice is added to the picture, as pitch is an inseparable element in many traditions of music. While vocal education is still progressing and evolving to accommodate transgender and gender non-conforming singers, it still remains very traditional.

## Jamie Paige & Trans Identity

{{ responsive_image(src="jamie-paige.jpg", alt="Jamie Paige's YouTube avatar") }}

Jamie Paige is an American Vocaloid producer who fuses elements of pop, EDM, and rock into her music. She is a transgender woman, and that reflects in her music. With the idea of voice dysphoria in mind, the natural instinct would be to assign the role of a “replacement voice” to voice synthesizers for transfeminine composers. However, this is not how Paige uses vocal synths.

In her song “Dyad,” the opening track from her most recent album “CONSTANT COMPANIONS,” Paige sings in a duet with the Synthesizer V voicebank ANRI, with Paige singing the verses and ANRI being assigned the choruses. Lyrically, Dyad is clearly framed as a love song, however it is somewhat unclear whether Paige and ANRI represent different voices or perspectives within the same individual, or whether it is truly a duet between two different people. In this song, Paige introduces what will become the primary driving motive behind Constant Companions as an album:

```
Baby, do you know what you wanna hear?
'Cause you can say the word, make it all so clear
Or you can sit around, watch it disappear
(Watch the truth, it breaks in two)
```

In this, Paige subverts the initial idea of the use of vocaloid by transfeminine artists to replace their own voice.

Skipping forward two tracks in Constant Companions, we come to “ROT FOR CLOUT.” In it, we find the first example of what I like to call “self-dehumanization.” Self-dehumanization is a theme that is present in the music of many transfeminine artists, and is characterized by expressions of detachment from the body, which often manifests itself as imagery of maiming the human body or treating it as an object, either in a sexual or non-sexual manner. The chorus of ROT FOR CLOUT goes as follows:

```
Yep, that’s right, let your dreams take flight
Watch the line go up, line go up, up up up up up
Until it breaks right through, blows a hole through you
You can fill it up, fill it up, fu- fu- fill it up
And all the meat will slide off the bone, so nice
You can eat it up, eat it up, eat eat eat eat eat
Until you're full of life, it’s a goddamn vibe
Baby, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
Oh we can fuck until the sun burns out
We can rot for clout
```

Another notable example of this theme is in the song “BUTCHER VANITY.” BUTCHER VANITY is a song created by the group FLAVOR FOLEY, which is composed of Jamie Paige, Vane Lily, and ricedeity. The song’s lyrics revolve around cannibalism, putting it next to language that is primarily used in the context of romantic or sexual love. This further demonstrates self-dehumanization as a theme. In addition to the elements of self-dehumanization, BUTCHER VANITY contains an interesting bit of technique on the part of the producers. BUTCHER VANITY utilizes the Synthesizer V voicebank Yi Xi, which is notable for having a rather large range in which it can sound good. In the first part of the verse, the melody is doubled in octaves. However, right before the chorus during the line “I wanna slit your throat and eat 'til I get sick,” the melody converges to a lower octave. In this song, FLAVOR FOLEY demonstrates how vocal synthesizers can be used to produce a vocal performance with an extreme fluidity of gender that cannot be practically replicated by most humans.

Two tracks in Constant Companions after ROT FOR CLOUT, we come to the track “Cadmium Colors.” Cadmium Colors revolves around one’s sense of identity as an artist and their artistic desires before they die. This is achieved through the metaphor of Cadmium pigments, which are mildly toxic to humans. While much of the lyrical content of this song can be applied to the artistic experience more generally, there is something to be said about how it can apply specifically to the trans experience:

```
We're all just searching for a sense of solidarity
To hold each other close and confiscate our destiny
No one wants to leave with a work undone
We only need a brush we can pass along
```

Finally, coming to perhaps the most explicit out of the transgender imagery in Constant Companions, we have “Machine Love.” Paige has implied before that this song is an allegory for the transgender experience, however it is still largely up for interpretation. On its face, Machine Love is a song about a machine (represented by the Synthesizer V voicebank Kasane Teto) learning to love a human and expressing its desire to become real. However, when we examine the lyrics, we can see the potential genderqueer interpretation:

```
So can we wander for a spell
And live in parallel
I want it to be true, to be like you
My heart sings a chorus out of tune
And I could leave it on a shelf
Or keep it to myself
But nothing could conceal the things I feel
My love, can you teach me to be real?
```

In this chorus, Teto asks to be taught how to become real. However, by gaining the ability to love, Teto has arguably already acquired one of the most important and elusive qualities of being alive. The definition of what is “real” in this situation is deliberately left ambiguous, and it’s unclear to the listener whether Teto really needs to become real. This maps well onto the desires of transgender people to become “real” members of their gender, when in reality it is an arbitrary label, and they already have the qualities necessary to consider themselves as such.

## Conclusion

Vocal synthesis technology provides a very interesting method of expression for artists, with the ability to utilize the expressiveness of the voice and the auxiliary means of expression that lyrics provide, while at the same time being able to minutely control the qualities of the vocals, and to shape them in ways that would be impossible with the voice of a real person. To many transgender people, the process of attempting to sculpt a voice is intimately familiar, with many having worked on their speech cadence and attempted to push their average pitch higher during vocal training. However, vocal synthesis can also be used to accentuate transgender voices, as evidenced by the music of Jamie Paige.
